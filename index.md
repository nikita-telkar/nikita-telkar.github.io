#### **About Me**  

:::: {style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: 2fr 1fr; grid-column-gap: 10px; "}

::: {}

A 3rd year PhD Candidate in the [Medical Genetics Graduate Program](https://medgen.med.ubc.ca/) at [The University of British Columbia](https://ubc.ca/), I currently reside in the lovely and vibrant city of Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada.

My research interests lie in developmental, cardiovascular, and population genetics. My curiosity is driven by wanting to elucidate the genetic differences that exist between populations of different ancestries.

I’m an avid bibliophile, coffee enthusiast, and culinary aficionado. I also make and sell custom genetics-themed graphics and merchandise on [Etsy](https://www.etsy.com/ca/shop/ScribblezbyNiki)!
